## MVC Crud Project (11/2017)
Description of my CRUD project and technologies I used for the project...

This project is a shopping list that allowed a user to add, view, edit, and delete items
from a preloaded HashMap. It also has images that are not in the original list that it will map to, if a user types in a specified word, e.g "Banana" will be matched with the banana.png image.

It is a Dynamic Web Project created using the Spring Tool Suite 3.9.1 which is built from the Eclipse Oxygen.1a (4.7.1a) platform. The backend was coded using Java.

Other technologies used were Gradle Build Automation System, .jst (JavaScript Templates) with jstl taglibs, such as the core, form, and format tag libraries. I applied EL (Expression Language) tags within the .jst files to create dynamic information on the page.

I employed Bootstrap for my page formatting rather than a .css stylesheet and incorporated mobile first design techniques within Bootstrap.

Model View controller
