## MVC Crud Project (11/2017)
Description of my CRUD project and technologies I used for the project:

This project is a shopping list that allows a user to search, add, view, edit, and delete items from a Mysql Database. It also has images that are not in the original list that it will map to, if a user types in a specified word, e.g "Banana" will be matched with the banana.png image.

It is a Dynamic Web Project created using the Spring Tool Suite 3.9.1 which is built from the Eclipse Oxygen.1a (4.7.1a) platform. The backend was coded using Java.

Other technologies used were Gradle Build Automation System, .jsp (Java Sever Pages) with jstl taglibs, such as the core, form, and format tag libraries. I applied EL (Expression Language) tags within the .jsp files to create dynamic information on the page.

Through the use of MAMP and MySQL, Database users are able to modify persistent data and employ search queries.

I used Bootstrap for my page formatting rather than a .css stylesheet.

Also, I made use of the MySQL Workbench for database design and management.
